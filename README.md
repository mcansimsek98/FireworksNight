# FireworksNight

The aim of this game is to explode five fireworks of different colors. If there are fireworks with the same color on the screen, select them, shake the phone and let the fireworks explode. You will get more points if you detonate all the fireworks floating on the screen. So detonating one firework is worth 200 points, but setting off five fireworks is worth 2500 points.
